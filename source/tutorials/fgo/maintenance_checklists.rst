Maintenance Checklists
----------------------

The FGO application includes a specific type of form, distinct from other forms within the application,
which serves as a maintenance checklist. This checklist can be requested for central heating boilers
(CV Ketels) and is dynamically generated to include maintenance points specific to the specified boiler.


The tutorial will be available shortly.
