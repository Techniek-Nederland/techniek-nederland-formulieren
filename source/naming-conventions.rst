Naming standards and conventions
======================

A first attempt has been made to produce a list of standard terms to use throughout the forms. There are many
ways to name something (eg. 'Naam', 'Voornaam + Achternaam', 'Volledige naam'). The draft version of this
document can be downloaded
`Form Fields Naming Convensions (XLSX) <_static/files/techniek-nederland-form-fields-naming-convention-v5.xlsx>`_. This
document is currently maintained by `Peter Zwakhals @ Techniek Nederland <mailto:p.zwakhals@TechniekNederland.nl>`_.
